    #1: Your dependent variable should be measured at the interval or ratio level (i.e., they are continuous).
    #2: Your independent variable should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. 
    #3: You should have independence of observations, which means that there is no relationship between the observations in each group or between the groups themselves.
    #4: There should be no significant outliers. 
#5: Your dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed for each category of the independent variable. 
#6: There needs to be homogeneity of variances.
