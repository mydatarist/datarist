  Goodman and Kruskal's gamma (G or γ) is a nonparametric measure of the strength and direction of association that exists between two variables measured on an ordinal scale. Whilst it is possible to analyse such data using Spearman's rank-order correlation or Kendall's tau-b, Goodman and Kruskal's gamma is recommended when your data has many tied ranks.
